# legal-contract-register
Registering and reviewing contracts. It allows users to submit a contract along with metadata, validates attachments (Word), triggers automated approval workflows (Security → Legal → Logistics), and sends notifications. Contract data is stored in a SharePoint register, while attachments are managed in a separate library with permission control
